# Changes
- Updated starting grenades/heal items
- Option to change heal time
- Removed lone survivr since I believe it has the chance to break some stuff (if you want to add back, search REMOVED_LONE_SURVIVOR)
- ~~Split bot code into bot.ts, botUtil.ts,  and botVariants.ts~~ this doesnt really work?

## Maps
- Added loot house building (has LOTS of loot, except it looks like a cabin)
